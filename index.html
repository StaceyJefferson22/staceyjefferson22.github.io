                        You are a new student on UofSC's campus, and you want to start networking with others, but you are having trouble connecting with people, or you are having a problem with finding things to do on campus. Our solution is to create an app that allows users to connect with their peers, professors, alumni, clubs, workplaces, etcâ€¦ on campus.

                        My teammates and I brainstorm together to create an affinity diagram for our social media app. This was a very fun process as it allowed us to bring out our creativeness. This will be useful in my future entreprenurial endeavors.
