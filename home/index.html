            <p> <strong class = "important">CSCE 242</strong> is a web development course instructed by Portia Plante. 
                It involves students mastering <strong>HTML</strong> and <Strong>CSS</Strong> to create the front-end of a website and later <strong>JavaScript</strong> to give it functionality. 
                The class composes of assignments, in-class assignments, a midterm project, and a final project. Face-to-face meetings occur <strong>Tuesdays and Thursday</strong>at 11:40-12:55pm.</p>
           
            <p> CSCE 242 is very similiar to CSCE 190. 
                They are both web development courses that utilize HTML and CSS. 
                However, 242 is a <strong>three-hour</strong> long course whereas 190 is a one-hour course. 
                Also, 242 includes JavaScript, which is not utilize in 190. </p>

                For my semster project, I must use all of my acquired knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a unique website. The following links
                shows the process it took to design this semester project from ideas and prototypes to finalized version. This process required alot of knowledge and help from
                various parties to make. It has been quite an enriching experience for me and put my problem-solving skills to the test.
              </p>
              <p>
                The business I will be using for this semster project will be Styling Trends of Elegance. This is a LLC owned by mother and grandmother and specializes in beauty 
                cosmetics for men and women alike via their partner AVON. As you look through the website, you will be met with some of the hottest items out on the market right now as
                well as a opportunity to become a representative under Styling Trends of Elegance yourself if you are interested. I hope you your time on this website.
