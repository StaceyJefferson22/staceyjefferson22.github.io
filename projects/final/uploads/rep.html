                <p>
                    Sharon Jefferson is a strong, brilliant, and independent woman and one of the two co-founders of Styling Trends of Elegance.
                    Jefferson graduated from Chesterfield High School in 1987 while also attending a cosmetology school. Afterwards, she continued her 
                    education at Winthrop University and earned a bachelor degrees in Fashion Merchadising/Business Administration. Jefferson's journey 
                    led her back to her home and becoming a AVON representative with her mother Sondra Sowell.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mrs. Jefferson has proved herself to be a hardworker as she balances her life as cosmetologist, AVON representative, and the glue to
                    her family. She is also persistant in her goals and will go to lengths to show how AVON will make dreams come true. Her work and presistancy has 
                    led her to receive several accolades including: being a member of the President's Club, a nine-time receipient of the Destination AVON award, being apart of the 
                    AVON Mentor Panel, and much more. With a lot of experience and accomplishments, Sharon Jefferson will help you reach your goals of achieving
                    maximal inner and outer beauty.

                        <h3>Sondra Sowell</h3>
                        <P>
                            Sondra Sowell is a wise, experience, and bold woman and is one of the two co-founders of Styling Trends of Elegance.
                            Sowell graduated from Gary High School in 1967. Rather than sticking the role of women to be a stay-at-home mom, she graduated
                            from cosmetology school and started her own salon called Sondra's Hair Palace. Three decades later, she will learn about the beauty 
                            cosmetics company AVON and join them as a local representative.
                        </P>
                        <p>
                            Growing up in a family as the oldest of eight children and spending the majority of her childhood without a mother, Ms. Sowell 
                            gained mental toughness and leadership skills. These traits has pushed her through life and taught her how to become a great
                            mother, grandmother, entrepreneur, and representative. She is defintion of defining the odds in a world where women are often
                            objectify and seen as nuturers for their children. Sowell has been recognized by AVON in a variety of ways including: being on
                            the Honor Society, a ten-time receipient of the Destination AVON award, and a receipient of AVON Leadership.
