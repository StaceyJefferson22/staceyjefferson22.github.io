        <h1>Football Brings Everybody Together</h1>
        <h2>Stacey Allen Jefferson Jr | CSCE 242</h2>

        <p>Football is one of the most prominent sports at the University of South Carolina (USC). On Saturadays, at the William Brice Stadium, you will see the fans, the student body, the alumni, the band, the cheerlanders, and much more cheer on the Football team as they go head-to-head against opponents in and out of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). At one point last year, the cheering was loud, it was mistaken for a earthquake. When the football teams thrives, USC thrives too.</p>
   
        <p>Back in 2021, Shane Beamer officially became the head coach for the USC's football team and led the Gamecocks to a 7-6 record and a victory against the University of North Carolin Tar 'N Heels (UNC) in the Mayo Bowl. The following year saw the team improved to a 8-5 record, but lost to Notre Dame in the Gator Bowl. Despite this setback, USC is back and better than ever with a team filled with both talented and motivated players. The Gamecocks first game to start the 2023 season will be against UNC at Bank of America Stadium. Go Gamecocks!!!</p>
