        <h2>What is a Lion?</h2>
        <p>Lions are from the genus panthera, which also includes leopards, jaguars,
            and tigers. Most lions you can found in Africa in the opens plains, bushes, and forest.
            Lions are only second to tigers when it comes to having  the reputation of the <strong>largest</strong> cat species as they are typically around 9 feet in length and 
            larger males weight around 550 pounds. They can deliver devastating blows that are enough to 
            destroying a zebra's back. They are also incredibly fast short distance runners.

            Lions are known for being <strong>prominent</strong> carnivores with males consuming up to 43 kgs of meat everyday.
            Their usual means of acquiring their food is by hunting and killing their prey. Their prey are normally large animals such as zebras and wildebeest. However,
            if they are limited in terms of choices, they will settle for small animals like rodents and reptiles. They also hunt in both small and large 
            groups known as prides, often consisting of several generation of lions. It has been speculated that female lions are 
            actually better hunters than their male counterparts. 

            Speaking of the female lions (as known as Lioness), they play a very pivotal role in the continued existence of lions.
            The lioness are known for raising their children(clubs) until they turn 2-3 years old. During this time, they will nuture them and 
            protect them from harms way, which includes their own kind. Lioness are <strong>very</strong> active when it comes to mating 
            and give birth to anywhere between two to six cubs.
            
            In conclusion, the lion's way of living is very interesting. They are naturally built hunters to the point that 
            even the females can defend themselves. Their strength, size, and speed are almsot second to none. 
            With these amazing attributes and characteristics displayed by Lions, it is no wonder why they
